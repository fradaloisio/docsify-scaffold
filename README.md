# **Welcome**
This repo contains a preconfigured Docsify installation (_scaffold_) that can be used as a technical documentation site.

# What is Docsify?
Docsify is a simple and lightweight documentation site generator that loads and parses Markdown files and displays them as a website.  
ðŸ’¡**Pretty smart uh?**  
You can visit the official documentation at  https://docsify.js.org

# How get started?
Just clone this repo.
```git
git clone 
```

# Why cloning this repo?
Even if configuring Docsify with all the plugin takes around 10 minutes, this is a scaffold to start with.
